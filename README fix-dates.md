# Fix Dates
**Background:**
Have you ever imported pictures from different devices and find the timestamp format is all whacked out.
Different formats and you would like to have one format.

This applications lets you do that.  Simply point to a directory and click scan.
Then  a table appears with all the files that would be renamed if you say **yes** to do the rename.
The table lets you skip files you don't want to rename or rename them all.
It optionally creates an undo-rename.bat file that lets you undo the rename operation if you wanted or needed to do so.

## Description
Scan a directory for files that match a date pattern and normalize the date pattern to YYYY-MM-DD HHMMSS (in 24 hour time).
Why this format?  Because that's the format I want.
